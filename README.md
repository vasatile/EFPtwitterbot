# My Twitter Automation Project

This project automates interactions with Twitter, such as fetching ENS followings, managing follows, mutes, blocks, and posting updates via a Twitter bot. It uses the Twitter API and OAuth for authentication, along with custom modules for different functionalities.

## Features

- **Fetch ENS Followings**: Retrieve and track ENS followings using the Twitter API.
- **Manage Follows**: Automatically follow users based on certain conditions.
- **Mute and Block Users**: Manage your mute and block lists via Twitter API.
- **Twitter Bot**: Post updates, tweet about ENS followings, and automate various tasks on Twitter.
- **Data Logging**: Save interaction data into CSV files for record-keeping.

## Requirements

To install the necessary dependencies, use the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Here are the main libraries required for the project:

- `requests`: To interact with web APIs and make HTTP requests.
- `requests-oauthlib`: To handle OAuth authentication with Twitter.
- `oauthlib`: Underlying library for OAuth implementation.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepository.git
   cd yourrepository
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up your Twitter API credentials in an environment file or modify the code to add your credentials directly.

4. Run the program:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Modules

- **FollowsAndTagsUrl**: Manages the URL structure for tracking follows and tags.
- **Follows**: Handles functionality related to following users.
- **EnsUrl**: Fetches the relevant ENS data.
- **FetchEns**: Logic for retrieving ENS followings.
- **Blocks**: Manages the block list on Twitter.
- **Mutes**: Manages the mute list on Twitter.
- **CSVWriter**: Writes output data to CSV files.
- **TwitterBot**: Automates posting updates and interacting with users.

## How to Use

1. **Twitter API Setup**: Set up a Twitter Developer account and create an application to get your API keys (API Key, API Secret Key, Access Token, and Access Token Secret).
2. **OAuth Setup**: The project uses OAuth 1.0a for authentication, which is handled via the `requests-oauthlib` library.

3. **Run the Automation**: After configuring the Twitter API and ensuring the necessary modules are set up, you can run the bot to automate the tasks described.

## Configuration

You'll need to configure your Twitter API credentials either in environment variables or directly in the code (though environment variables are more secure).

Example environment variable setup:

```bash
export TWITTER_API_KEY='your_api_key'
export TWITTER_API_SECRET_KEY='your_secret_key'
export TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN='your_access_token'
export TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET='your_access_token_secret'
```
